# ðŸ”§ Netlify Deploy Fix - Build Command Error

## Problem Identified
From your deploy log, Netlify was failing because the original build command was trying to run `node copy-redirects.js` before the build directory existed.

## âœ… Fixed Build Configuration

### Updated netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm install && npx vite build && cp public/_redirects dist/public/_redirects || echo '/*    /index.html   200' > dist/public/_redirects"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.18.0"
  NPM_VERSION = "9.8.1"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### What This Does
1. **npm install** - Installs dependencies  
2. **npx vite build** - Builds your React app
3. **cp public/_redirects dist/public/_redirects** - Copies routing file
4. **|| echo fallback** - Creates _redirects if copy fails

## Alternative Netlify Settings

If the updated `netlify.toml` still has issues, try these build commands in your Netlify dashboard:

### Option 1: Simple Build
```bash
npm install && npx vite build
```

### Option 2: With Manual _redirects
```bash
npm install && npx vite build && echo '/*    /index.html   200' > dist/public/_redirects
```

### Option 3: Force Copy
```bash
npm ci && npx vite build && cp public/_redirects dist/public/ || echo '/*    /index.html   200' > dist/public/_redirects
```

## Manual Override (If All Else Fails)

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Build & deploy
   - Override build settings:
     - **Build command**: `npm install && npx vite build`
     - **Publish directory**: `dist/public`
     - **Base directory**: (leave empty)

2. **Add _redirects manually:**
   - After build succeeds, add this redirect rule in Netlify dashboard:
   - From: `/*` To: `/index.html` Status: `200`

## Root Cause Analysis

**Original Issue:**
- Build command: `npm ci && npx vite build && node copy-redirects.js`
- The Node script was running before understanding directory structure
- Exit code 1 meant the script failed

**Current Solution:**
- Uses shell commands instead of Node script
- Built-in fallback if file copy fails
- More compatible with Netlify's build environment

## Verification Steps

After deployment, check:
1. âœ… Build completes without errors
2. âœ… Site loads at your Netlify URL
3. âœ… All navigation works (Home, Courses, etc.)
4. âœ… Direct page URLs work (no 404 on refresh)
5. âœ… _redirects file exists in build output

Your Tachyon website should now deploy successfully on Netlify!
