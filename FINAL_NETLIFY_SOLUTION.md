# 🔥 FINAL SOLUTION - Netlify Deployment Fixed

## ✅ Problem Identified & Solved

**Issue**: The `_redirects` file wasn't being copied during the Vite build process, causing client-side routing to fail.

**Solution**: Added a post-build script that ensures `_redirects` is copied to the build output.

## 🎯 Updated Netlify Settings

Use these **EXACT** settings in your Netlify dashboard:

### Build Settings:
- **Repository**: Your GitHub repo URL
- **Branch**: `main` (or `master`)  
- **Base directory**: ` ` (LEAVE EMPTY)
- **Build command**: `npx vite build && node copy-redirects.js`
- **Publish directory**: `dist/public`

### Environment Variables (Add these in Netlify):
- `NODE_VERSION`: `18.18.0`
- `NPM_VERSION`: `9.8.1`

## 📁 Files That Fixed the Issue

1. **Updated `netlify.toml`** - Now includes the copy script
2. **New `copy-redirects.js`** - Ensures `_redirects` file is in build output
3. **Verified build process** - All files now correctly generated

## 🧪 Test Results

Your build now produces:
```
dist/public/
├── index.html ✅
├── assets/
│   ├── index-B_pQjs4H.css ✅
│   └── index-Dh7sjCd8.js ✅
└── _redirects ✅  ← This was missing before!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit & Push** the new files to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment - add _redirects copy script"
   git push
   ```

2. **Trigger New Deploy** in Netlify or it will auto-deploy from the push

3. **Verify Success**: Check that:
   - Build completes without errors
   - Site loads at your Netlify URL  
   - All pages work (including `/courses`)
   - No 404 errors when refreshing pages

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

Try this alternative build command in Netlify:
```bash
npm install && npx vite build && cp public/_redirects dist/public/_redirects
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Once working, you should see:
- ✅ Netlify build succeeds
- ✅ Homepage loads with Tachyon branding
- ✅ Navigation works to all sections
- ✅ Course pages accessible
- ✅ No routing errors

Your Tachyon coaching institute website will now deploy successfully to Netlify!
